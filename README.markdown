This is a repository of useful layout templates for typesetting using
ConTeXt.

## markdown2pdf/lesspaper-ltr.tex

This template gives you a context template that works with John MacFarlane's
excellent `markdown2pdf` utility. 

The goal of this template is to use less paper. I did this by reducing margins
to acceptable limits. The printed paper has enough margins to allow for spiral
binding using the standard multihole punch, even when printed on both sides.

The font size is 10pt, which is big enough for me to read.

I made this template because I don't like to waste paper, but I do love reading
long technical documents on paper.

To see this  template in action, run `markdown2pdf/bstringlib.sh` to download
the documentation for the `bstrlib` C library, convert it to suitable markdown
format and in turn convert into a print ready PDF using `markdown2pdf`.
