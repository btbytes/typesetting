This is a repository of useful layout templates for typesetting using
ConTeXt.

## markdown2pdf/lesspaper-ltr.tex

This template gives you a [ConTeXt](http://wiki.contextgarden.net) template that works with John MacFarlane's
excellent `pandoc` utility. 

The goal of this template is to use less paper. I did this by reducing margins
to acceptable limits. The printed paper has enough margins to allow for spiral
binding using the standard multi-hole punch, when printed on both sides.

The font size is 10pt, which is big enough to read.

I made this template because I don't like to waste paper, but I do love reading
long documents on paper.

To see this  template in action, run `markdown2pdf/bstringlib.sh` to download
the documentation for the [bstrlib](bstring.sourceforge.net) C library, convert it to suitable markdown
format and in turn convert into a print ready PDF using `markdown2pdf`.
